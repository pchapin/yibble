Yibble
======

Yibble is a simple text editor that uses curses directly. It is inteded for Unix-like platforms
only. The main purpose of Yibble is educational. It is simple enough to be understood by
students in a first or second semester programming course, yet rich enough to be useful and to
serve as a source of realistic programming exercises.
